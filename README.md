# Recipe Sharing App 

This is a group project for my Special Topics in Software Engineering: Android Development class where we created an android application for the sharing of recipes.

## How to Edit on Android Studio

1. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) this repository into your working machine.
2. Make sure that you have [Java](https://www.oracle.com/ph/java/technologies/downloads/) installed in your machine. It is recommended to use Java 11 or older.
3. Open Android Studio.
4. Open the cloned directory in Android Studio.

## How to Run

1. Download and install the debug APK from [here](https://github.com/angelo-dlcrz/CSCI181.04-Final-Project/releases/download/1.0/Recipe-Sharing_v1.0.0.apk).

Enjoy!
